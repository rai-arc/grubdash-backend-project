## Details

This GrubDash backend code was created as part of Thinkful's curriculum.
[Thinkful](https://www.thinkful.com/) led me to create this application as part of their curriculum to demostrate my understanding of Express and backend development.
I set up an API following RESTful design principles, wrote custom middleware functions, and built specific routes for this project while maintaining logical and easy to read names for variables and functions.

Dishes accept input in the form of names, descriptions, prices, and image urls.
Orders accept input in the form of delivery addresses, mobile numbers, and an array of dishes.
